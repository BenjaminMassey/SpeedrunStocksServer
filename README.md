## Summary

Server side of SpeedrunStocks. Acts as the link between the streamer and their chat. Handles the bot that runs in chat, and sends commands to the streamer's side.

## Code

This project is currently written entirely in Java.
It has been written mostly by me, with some additions as seen in the "Thank Yous" section.
It has been initially worked on as [BeanBoyBot](https://www.github.com/BenjaminMassey/BeanBoyBot/) - being split up and rebranded for the sake of outside usage.

This project uses Pircbot as base:

## Thank Yous

Shoutout to Dark_Tenka for helping out with certain parts of the bot, including the majority of the dividends system - I really appreciate his help <3.

Shoutouts to my various viewers for helping test the bot - they've got some great ideas <3.

Shoutouts to Clint Stevens for sparking this idea in my head, even though it was mainly his chat and it was just a barely related meme <3.
